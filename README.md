SMU Capstone project - a comparative evaluation of recommender systems for hotels
by Ryan Khaleghi, Raghuram Srinivas (advisor)

Using TripAdvisor hotel review data from the UIUC repository, I compared Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization models.
Review text was handled using a TF-IDF Vectorizer and Linear Support Vector Machine to classify review texts as numerical scores.

Future work is the Neural Network NLP project, where I handle these same review texts using neural networks.
